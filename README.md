# Animal-classification-Project-1
This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify animal images using the Animal Image Classification Dataset. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand basic image preprocessing, CNN model building, and performance evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab.
