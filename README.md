# Animal-classification-Project-1
This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify animal images using the Animal Image Classification Dataset. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand basic image preprocessing, CNN model building, and performance evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras in Google Colab.
## Animal Image Classifier using CNN

This project builds a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify animal images using the [Animal Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borhanitrash/animal-image-classification-dataset). 

## Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess animal images
- Build and train a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualize training graphs and predictions
- Save the trained model and build a GitHub repository

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
